MVP
- As a parent, I want a Login system so I can see my information.
- As a Parent, I want to make a medicine routine in order to allow my children to take their medicine.
- As a parent, I want to add medicine to the list if it does not already exist, in order to keep the list accurate.
- As a kid, I want to have an understandable description of what the medicine does, so I can know why I am taking it.
- As a kid, I want a Reward system to give me incentive to take my medicine.
- As a parent, I want a Reminder system so I can be told if my kids have not had their medicine.

Extras
- As a parent/kid, I would like to have an Image of the medicine so I know what the medicine looks like
- As a busy parent, I would like the reminders to be sent to my mobile, so I can still receive them on the go.
